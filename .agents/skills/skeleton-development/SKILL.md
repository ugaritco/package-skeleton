# Skeleton Development

## Primary Goal

Evolve the starter kit without making it less useful for future package authors.

## Workflow

1. Preserve generic placeholders such as `:author_name`, `:package_name`, `:vendor_slug`, and `:package_slug` until the configure flow replaces them.
2. Keep starter guidance minimal and split skeleton-maintenance rules from package-author rules.
3. Use temporary phase scaffold tests when proving repository shape, file parity, or generated scaffolding; delete those tests before final validation.
4. Maintain skeleton guidance in `AGENTS.md`, package guidance in `AGENTS_PACKAGE.md`, and package-facing local skills in `.agents/skills`; `configure.php` generates package `AGENTS.md`, then links `CLAUDE.md` to `AGENTS.md` and `.claude` to `.agents` during package configuration.
5. Keep `configure.php` feature and tool pruning maps, opt-in non-interactive `--[feature]` and `--[tool]` flags, service provider wiring, Composer metadata, `README_PACKAGE.md`, `AGENTS_PACKAGE.md`, AI guidance, skills, and publishable files aligned.
6. Keep configure-only dependencies in `require-dev`, include them in configure dependency checks, and prune them through the configure `composer remove --no-install` step so the configured package's `composer.json` and `composer.lock` stay in sync.
7. Preserve the non-interactive contract: metadata validators run against flag and default values before any file changes, results print as single-line JSON on stdout, and `--no-interaction`, `COMPOSER_NO_INTERACTION=1`, agent detection, and non-TTY stdin all trigger the mode.
8. Keep development-time authoring files out of Composer dist archives with `.gitattributes` when they are not runtime package files.

## References

- `AGENTS.md`
- `AGENTS_PACKAGE.md`
- Linked `CLAUDE.md`
- `README.md`
- `README_PACKAGE.md`
- `.agents/skills/`
- Linked `.claude/`
- `configure.php`
- `.gitattributes`
- `PLAN.md`, `REQS.md`, and `phases/` when present

## Examples

- Add or rename local guidance under `AGENTS.md`, `AGENTS_PACKAGE.md`, or `.agents/skills`, then update front matter names, root guidance, and any scaffold consistency checks.
- Add temporary Phase tests to lock down generated file shape, run them to prove the change, then delete them before the final `composer test`.
- Update package-facing README content in `README_PACKAGE.md`; `README.md` should stay focused on using this skeleton.
- When adding a selectable package feature, add both the starter files and the matching configure pruning behavior so package authors can select or omit it cleanly.
- When adding or renaming a selectable feature or tool key, verify the derived non-interactive flag includes only the expected generated files.
- When adding a configure-only helper package, update `dependenciesAreInstalled()`, the `removeConfigureDependencies()` package list, and temporary copied-skeleton configure checks together.

## Anti-Patterns

- Leaving temporary phase tests in the shipped starter suite.
- Putting skeleton-maintenance rules into package-facing skills.
- Replacing placeholders with one real package name in starter files.
- Adding runtime dependencies for repository-maintenance convenience.
